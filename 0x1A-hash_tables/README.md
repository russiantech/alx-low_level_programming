In PHP, hash tables are ordered. Waitâ€¦ WAT? How is this even possible?



Before you continue, please take a moment to think about it: how you would implement it if you were asked to during an interview or a job. What data structures would you use? How would it work?

For this task, please:

Read PHP Internals Book: HashTable
Use the same hash function
Use these data structures:[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A
